# Requirements

As we discussed earlier in the last part, we will use `Llama-cpp` library in Python to build our app.

*Note: Although we try to optimize our script to run on old devices, still make sure to have atleast 8GB of RAM. Because we'll need to load the model into our RAM first*

*Note: I'll try my best to use libraries and commands that are available on all OSs*

So here's a short list of **requirements**:

- A windows, Linux or Mac device *(Our app will be cross-platform so use whatever you want)*

- Python3.x *(I'll use 3.10 in this walkthrough)*

- A Python IDE *(I'll use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/))*

- At least 8GB of RAM

- A decent CPU

And that's all we need

# Let's prepare

First thing first, we need to install Python. I assume you already know how to install it... But here's a quick guide:

1. Go to [Python official website](https://python.org)

2. Navigate to Download section

3. Download your desired version *(we'll use 3.10)* and install

Second, we need to prepare our environment. Using `venv` library, we can create an isolated environment for our project, without needing to install all libraries on our main system. It would basically make it easier to manage dependencies. *You can read more about venv [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).*

So let's create our project folder: *You can use command line or create it manually. We'll use command line through the whole project*

```shell
$ mkdir PyChatbot
$ cd PyChatbot
```

We would need multiple folders for different files. For source codes, models and so on:

```shell
$PyChatbot/ mkdir src
$PyChatbot/ mkdir models
```

`venv` is already installed through Python. So let's create our environment:

```shell
$PyChatbot/ python -m venv venv
```

After it finishes, we should see a folder named `venv` in our project folder:

```shell
$PyChatbot/ ls

    Directory: F:\PyChatbot

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name

d-----         7/22/2024   9:40 AM                src
d-----         7/22/2024   9:40 AM                venv
```

To activate the environment:

- Linux and Mac:

```bash
$PyChatbot/ source venv/bin/activate
```

- Windows:

```powershell
$PyChatbot\ .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now you should be seeing a `(venv)` in your shell:

This means our environment is activated and when we install a library using `pip`, it would only install it for this project and not for the whole system. Also we can manage multiple python versions when creating our venv. In overall, this is a usefull tool to manage our project. So everytime you want to run our script or install a library, make sure the env is activated.

Now let's install `llama-cpp-python` library. It's basically a python binding for `llama-cpp` library which is written in C++. It allows us to call its functions directly into our script using only Python. 

There are multiple ways to install this. We can use multiple backend like vulkan, CUDA, OpenBLAS, Metal and so on. As we're writing this app to run on almost any device, i think using a pre-built wheel would be a better approach. `llama-cpp-python` has a pre-built wheel with simple CPU support *(we may or may not install another backend later in our walkthrough. For now, the basic CPU support is ok)*.

You can read more about `llama-cpp-python` library [here](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python).

Now let's install:

```shell
$(venv)PyChatbot/ pip install llama-cpp-python \
  --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cp
```

It took a moment:

So, we installed python, prepaired our coding environment and installed the most important library we needed. We'll start coding our app in the next part.
