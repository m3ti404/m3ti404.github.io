# Mehdi Vahabi
I'm a bug bounty hunter and penetration tester. I started as a penetration tester but continued to work as a bug bounty hunter. I'm still a newbie but i am constantly trying to get better and better.
### My hobbies:
- Python. I enjoy scripting tools that helps me find vulneribilities faster in Python.
- C/C++. The first programming language i learned, was C, And i love coding C to create applications as a fun project.
- Game Hacking, Malware analysis and Reverse engineering. I'm kinda new in these but i'm really passionate about them.
- Game Development. Since i was a child, i dreamed of creating my own video games. I still remember playing the first time i played Street Fighter II on my Sega Genesis and i asked myself "Will i ever create my own game like this?"
- AI. I'm new into this but i found it fun so i started learning about it. I know it might be a bit tought... But i'm sure i can learn it.
### My skills:
- OWASP Top 10
- Network+
- CEH
- Linux, Bash
- Python

# This Blog
As i'm passionate about learning new things everyday, I decided to create my own blog to post my progression. 
I will post my bug bounty write-ups, scripting stuff, coding applications, game development walkthroughs, malware analysis guides and etc.
There's no main subject to this blog... Sometimes i'm in the scripting mood, So i start scripting some tools and post the step-by-step coding guide in this blog,
Sometimes i'm in the binary mood, So i do some game hacking and post the step-by-step guide here.

I'm still newbie in many subjects, But i try to become better and post my thoughts and my views on things i'm learning... So maybe i could guide others too...

### Hope you enjoy❤️
